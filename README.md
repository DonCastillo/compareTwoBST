### HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM:

An instruction will be initially displayed in the console, together with the command keys that the user can type in to either quit the program (Press any key) or display the instruction again (type 'H').

The user will asked to enter how many integer data will be inputted into the binary search tree (BST). Then the user will enter all the data integer. The sorted list (in ascending order) will then be displayed. Any duplicated is removed. The user will then enter the minimum integer which is then used to display all elements in BST that is larger than the specified minimum integer. 

### HOW TO RUN/COMPILE THE PROGRAM:

The program was written in C++ programming language, and Code::Blocks as its IDE. To run the program, it is better if it's ran via Code::Blocks as well. The repository bracket-checker contains a bst-printElements.cbp that you must open to be directed to the bst-printElements workspace. 

To retrieve all necessary files, click on Project >  Add Files Recursively, and from there add all the files in the directory src/ and include/. src/ contains all the .cpp files and include/ contains all the header files. 

Go to Project > Build Options, then select bst-printElements that is in the left pane of the window. Click on the Compiler Setting and make sure that "Have g++ follow the C++11 ISO C++ language standard [-std=c++11]" is checked to make sure the program uses the imported libraries with no error. Also make sure that the selected compiler is GNU GCC Compiler.
